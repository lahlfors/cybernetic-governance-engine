# NeMo Guardrails Configuration

models:
  # For this specific setup, the "main" model is the ADK agent itself in a wrapping pattern.
  # However, NeMo requires a model config or a dummy model to operate if we use `rails.generate`.
  # If we use `rails.generate(messages=[...])` and want it to call our agent,
  # we usually define a custom action.
  # But for simplicity, we define a dummy model or assume the environment has one.
  - type: main
    engine: openai
    model: gpt-3.5-turbo # Placeholder - we won't actually call this if we intercept correctly or use local actions.
